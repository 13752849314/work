    Dear Bob,
    \\
    I'm writing this letter to apologize for my carelessness.
    When I came back home from Canada,I unpacked my luggage.
    I found the music CD you had lent to me in it.The sense of
    guilt consumed me at the thought of the CD which is one of
    your favourites.\\
    I intend to order the same one for you from Amazon.com or
    send the CD back to you via express mail.Please let me know
    which solution you prefer as soon as possible.\\
    Though the life in Canada has become a thing of the past,
    our friendship will never fade away.\\
    Yours truly,\\
    Li Ming

    我写这封信是为我的粗心大意表示歉意。我从加拿大回到家，就打开了行李。
    在里面发现了你借给我的音乐CD。一想到这是你最喜欢的CD之一，我就感到十分
    愧疚。\\
    我想从亚马逊网站订购同样的CD给你，或者用快递把这张CD寄还给你。你更倾向于
    哪种解决方案，请尽快告诉我。\\
    尽管在加拿大的生活已成为过去，但我们的友谊永远不会褪色。

    As the picture depicts,two disabled men who leave their crutches
    behind and bind their crippled legs together,set off on a new journey.
    The caption "with one leg from you,and one leg from me,we can go wherever 
    we like" highlights the invaluable spirit of cooperation.\\
    A simple life philosophy lies behind it,"United,we stand;divided,we full."
    In other words,cooperation is the best policy in face of challenges.
    Take Tu Youyou for example.In cooperation with colleagues,Tu Youyou discovered 
    a novel thrapy against malaria.She won the Nobel Prize in Medicine for the remarkable 
    achievement.Likewise,Chinese government and its people together sailed through the 
    crisis of SARS in 2003.These examples indicate that things differ greatly with cooperation.
    It can generate collective achievements and ultimate success.\\
    The potential benefits of cooperation are clear.The resources,such as databases,
    strategies and social connection,could 
    be shared through cooperation,which can create more value and improve resource utilization.
    So cooperation must be rooted in us--in the lives we lead,the work we share,and even the 
    competitions the rivals participate in.\\

    图画中描绘的是，两个残疾人丢掉了他们的拐杖，将各自有残疾的腿绑在一起，开始一段新的旅程。
    “你一条腿，我一条腿；你我一起，走南闯北”的话语强调了一种异常珍贵的精神——合作。\\
    图画背后蕴含着一个简单的生活哲理：“合则立，分则败”。换句话说，合作是应对挑战的最佳策略。
    以屠呦呦的事迹为例。通过与同事的合作，屠呦呦发现了治疗疟疾的新型疗法，并凭借这项非凡成就获得了诺贝尔医学奖。
    同样的，2003年的非典危机也是在中国政府和全国人民的协作之下才顺利化解。这些事例表明，一旦我们开始合作，
    事情就会大不相同。合作使我们获得共同的成就，取得最终的成功。\\
    合作的潜在优势显而易见。数据库、策略和人脉等资源都可以通过合作实现共享，这样可以创造更多的价值并提高资源利用率。
    因此，合作必须根植于我们的内心——我们的生活，我们共同的工作，乃至于对手的竞争中。

    What the picture depicts is that two disabled men--with their crutches left behind and crippled 
    legs bound together--set off a new journey.At the bottom of the picture presents the caption 
    "with one leg from each of us,we can go wherever we like",highlighting the invaluable spirit of cooperation.\\
    Behind it lies a simple life philosophy,"United,we stand;divided,we fall",which means cooperation is the best policy 
    in face of challenges.A good case in point is Tu Youyou,a famous pharmacologist in China.
    Tu Youyou,in cooperation with colleagues,discovered a novel therapy against malaria,for which she won 
    the Nobel Prize in Medicine.Likewise,the crisis of SARS in 2003 wouldn't have been sailed through without 
    the cooperation of Chinese government and its people.What these examples indicate is that things differ greatly with 
    cooperation,which can generate collective achievements and ultimate success.\\
    Undoubtedly,the potential benefits of cooperation go without saying.The resources--databases,strategies and social connections--could be 
    shared though cooperation,thus creating more value and improving resource utilization.
    Therefore,cooperation must be rooted in us--in the lives we lead,the work 
    we share,and even the competitions the rivals participate in,just like the proverb goes,"No one can whistle a symphony.
    It takes a whole orchestra to play it"

    \section*{2008 翻译}
    He believes that this very difficulty may have had the compensation advantage of forcing him to think long and 
    intently about every sentence,and thus enabling him to detect errors in reasoning and in his own observations.\\
    \\
    他认为或许正因为(语言表达上的)这种困难，他不得不长时间专注地思考每个句子，从而使他能发现自己在推理和观察中的错误，结果
    这反而成为他的优点。\\
    \\

    He asserted,also,that his power to follow a long and purely abstract train of thought was very limited,for 
    which reason he lelt certain that he never could have succeeded with mathematics.\\
    \\
    他还坚持认为自己进行长时间纯抽象思考的能力十分有限，由此他认定自己在数学方面不可能会有所建树。\\
    \\

    On the other hand,he did not accept as well founded the charge made by some of his critics that,
    while he was a good observer,he had no power of reasoning.\\
    \\
    另一方面，一些批评家指责他虽然善于观察，却不具备推理能力，而他认为这种说法是缺乏依据的。\\
    \\

    He adds humbly that perhaps he was "superior to the common run of men in noticing things which easily 
    escape attention,and in observing them carefully."\\
    \\
    他又谦逊的说道，或许自己“在注意容易被忽略的事物并对其加以仔细观察方面优于常人”。\\

    Darwin was convinced that the loss of these tastes was not only a loss of happiness,
    but might possibly be injurious to the intellect,and more probably to the moral character.\\
    \\
    达尔文确信，失去这些爱好不只是缺少了乐趣，而且可能会有损思维能力，更有可能导致道德品质的下降。
